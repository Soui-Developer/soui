* Scenario 1: Making a boolean be true [5/8]

The aim of this scenario is to model a world where the only thing we care about is the value of a
boolean variable, called "worldPeace".

There's only one user, and one action: to set the variable to True.

The expected flow is:

  - [X] The user describes the very simple world model.
  - [X] The user provides the current state (the variable is currently False).
  - [X] The user provides a utility function which says that worldPeace=False is 0 points and
    worldPeace=True is worth 100 points.
  - [X] The system does some thinking, and determines that worldPeace=True is the most desirable end
    state.
  - [X] The system asks the user to provide an action to help move towards that state.
  - [ ] The user provides the "achieveWorldPeace" action, which is said to set the worldPeace
    variable to True.
  - [ ] The system does some thinking, and determines that invoking the achieveWorldPeace action
    will bring about a more optimal state.
  - [ ] The system asks the user to perform the achieveWorldPeace action.
